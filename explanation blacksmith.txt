If you find bugs or have suggestions concerning this system,
please contact Horian at official Nox boards.
The file contains a selfextracting exe which needs as 
path the nox main folder. It will overwrite many (!) files - 
all with weapons or armor like race definition or lootlists 
for example. So if you already modified these, please 
copy the content by hand into them. 
There is an update included for the Nox-GMTool 
(version of Accomplice I made) for the sections SCP 
Items Shields, Weapon, Armor . You need to install 
Accomplice from  
http://nobbz.ssh3.de/wbboard/thread.php?...7&styleid=1 
to use this update.

It contains that all items produceable by blacksmith had 
to be re-sorted and get new item ID's in xss-files. 
We have shields, weapons and armor a blacksmith can 
do in 10 colors (copper, bronze, silver, gold, iron, 
merkite, valorite, verite, agaptite and shadow) with a 
SMALL system for blacksmithing with skill dependent 
changed high damage of weapon and armor value of 
armor. Name of the item is changed depending on its 
quality. 
Nox allows only 30 letters for name and no item title so 
the name of the item after production is still buggy when
 longer than this. 
Rank system so far has no impact on arms lore and so is
 not integrated. 
Skill check is integrated, ingot check is integrated for 
number and color. Distance check to forge is integrated.

Forge is the trigger item for our system. You need to
put "@ONDBLCLICK _schmieden" into its xss-definition. 
Player needs to have a blacksmithing tool like tong 
oder hammer in his backpack, too.
