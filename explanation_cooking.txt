This package can ONLY be used as "ADDON" to the blacksmithing
system from gerNox since its modification are basing on these!
If you find bugs or have suggestions concerning this system,
please contact Horian at official Nox boards.
The file contains a selfextracting exe which needs as 
path the nox main folder. It will overwrite (!) some files - 
all with foods, drinks or dishes like menus or item 
definitions for example. So if you already modified these, 
please copy the content by hand into them. 

There is an update included for the Nox-GMTool 
(version of Accomplice I made) for the sections SCP 
Plants, Food and Drinks . You need to install 
Accomplice from  http://nobbz.ssh3.de/wbboard/thread.php?...7&styleid=1 
to use this update.

It contains that all items which are cook-, drink or 
eatable had to be re-sorted and get new item ID's in 
xss-files. 
All kinds of items for eating, drinking or dishes from inside
UO and all kinds of plants are inluded in nox with this 
cooking system.
It has links for osi-farming and planting in it too, but at the
moment this system is not possible to do with nox so 
these links are disabled.
The recepies for cooking you can find at
http://uo.stratics.com/content/guides/cookessay.shtml
Items which are a pile (eg two bottles or three) are not drink- or
eatable, a "split in seperate bottles" is on its way.
