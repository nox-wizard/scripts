-TOPIC is the topic title
-TEXT starts the help text, what will be shown when a player types 'help <topictitle>.
You can leave blanks before keywords, they will be recognized anyway.

Leaving a blank line after the help text closes the topic, after the blank line you can start a new topic.
Between the blank line and the next TOPIC you can write what you want, it won't be read.
