This eat/drink system bases on the hunger/thirst local vars
introduced when char logs on (see charlogin.sma). It lowers 
hunger and thirst every three minutes for 3 points, range is
0-100 (zero means death but untill now no death is integrated).
The speech command +hunger ingame shows the char how much hunger
and thirst he has.
Every eat- or drinkable food Item in cookitems.xss has a value
how much it increases (or decreases) hunger or thirst (right now 
all items increase depending if food or drink the value by 2) 
100 is the highest possible value.
If an Item calls eatanddrink.sma without a definition if food or drink,
an error is logged in error.log containing the item and person using
it.
This script is not osi-style so need not be installed but since
several people asked me for this, I did it. ;)
